This code provides two functions, draw_cat_plot() and draw_heat_map(), to visualize the relationship between various health factors and the presence of cardiovascular disease in a dataset. The draw_cat_plot() function creates a categorical plot using seaborn's catplot() function to show the counts of each feature (cholesterol, glucose, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, and overweight status) for individuals with and without cardiovascular disease. The draw_heat_map() function calculates the correlation matrix for the dataset and generates a heatmap using seaborn's heatmap() function to show the correlation coefficients between each pair of features. The heatmap is masked to only show the lower triangle of the correlation matrix.
